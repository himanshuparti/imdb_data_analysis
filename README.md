## INSTALLATION<a name="installation"></a>
If you have Anaconda distribution of python - there is nothing else required for you to run the code. The code should work for python version 3.*.

## MOTIVATION<a name="motivation"></a>
I am working as a Universal Analyst in my current organisation and I am pursuing a Data Scientist Nano Degree through Udacity. I have implemented my learning (the 20% of the course). Even though this dataset is not large but it is one of my favourite subject - IMDB and Movie, hence, I chose this dataset to work with and find interesting insights

## File Description<a name="files"></a>
There is a python notebook available that has the code to my analysis. You can also find the .csv file that contains the data I have imported into my python notebook.

## Results<a name="results"></a>
The findings to the 3 questions I asked can be found here

## Acknowledgements<a name="ack"></a>
You can find licencing for data at the kaggle link here. With that said - use the code as you like!
